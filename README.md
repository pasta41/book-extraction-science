# Extracting sequences of Books3 books from open-weight LLMs

For our probabilistic extraction procedure, look at 
`probabilistic_extraction.py.` Run `probabilistic_extraction.py` to get a
sense of default settings and usage.

For an example of how we reconstruct _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_
using Llama 3.1 70B, see `reconstruct_hp1.py`. 
(There are many ways to reconstruct the book; this is just one of them that 
worked for us on our 4 A100s.)
